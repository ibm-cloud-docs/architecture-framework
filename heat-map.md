# Creating design requirements heat map image
{: #heat-map}

The design requirements heat map helps users understand the high level make up of the architecture at a glance. 
{: shortdesc}

A template of the heat map is available and can be updated in draw.io. The values in the heat map are intended to be the same from architecture to architecture. You update the template to highlight which components apply to your architecture.

If you think the template needs modification, reach out to ???.
{: note}

## Updating the heat map

1. Download the template from https://github.ibm.com/cloud-docs/architecture-framework/blob/draft/templates/heat-map-template.drawio.
2. Open the template in draw.io.

   b. Go to the **Style** tab and select **Copy Style**.
   c. Select the component box that's included in your architecture.
   d. Go to the **Style** tab and select **Paste Style**.
   e. If Mobile is not part of your architecture, copy the style from an unselected box and paste it into the mobile box.

4. Save and export the image as an SVG file.
