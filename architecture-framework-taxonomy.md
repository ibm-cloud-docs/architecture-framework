# Architecture framework aspects and domains
{: #taxonomy}

The architecture framework is a technology-agnostic, enterprise architecture approach to create hybrid cloud solutions. The taxonomy ensures that consumers of architectures can quickly discover and use the architecture for their needs.

## Aspects
{: #aspects}

The Aspects are shown in column 1 and cover the different layers of the solution stack, from IT infrastructure through the application, as well as non-functional requirements and operational aspects.

The application platform aspect includes some of the application workload types and can be extended to include additional workloads. The Data aspect covers common application data requirements.

Most of the aspects, like Compute, Storage, Networking, Security and Resiliency are self-explanatory because they describe either the IT environment or common non-functional requirements that are table stakes for any enterprise solution.

The DevOps and Service Management cover the operational aspects of the solution. The Managed Services aspect captures professional services provided by 3rd party service integrators or service providers to help enterprise customers design, migrate, deploy, or manage workloads.

## Domains
{: #domains}

Domains are the capabilities or functions within an aspect. For example, within the Security aspect, Data Security, Identity and Access Management, and Application Security are examples of functions contained in that aspect.

Each domain then contains a set of component options available to meet solution requirements.

## Components
{: #components}

The component options for each domain are determined by the target cloud deployment model and cloud service provider under consideration.

Components are products or technology choices that satisfy the requirements for a specific category. Components options are determined by the target cloud service provider.
