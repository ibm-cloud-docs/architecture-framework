# Why use the architecture framework?
{: #why-use-framework}

Designing a cloud solution by using the architecture framework enables a more consistent approach to solutioning across the breadth of your cloud portfolio, which in turn decreases the solution process time and delivery risks.
{: shortdesc}

Using the architecture framework also provides the structure to create reusable, repeatable solution architecture references and guidance which leads to the standardization of enterprise cloud solution design and the avoidance of one-of-a-kind snowflake solutions that are expensive to deploy, enhance, and maintain.

The architecture framework can be used as a guide to ensure you have considered applicable requirements for each "aspect" and "domain". After you have identified the applicable requirements, you can evaluate and select the best fit for purpose components for your enterprise cloud solution.
