# Designing a cloud solution by using the architecture framework
{: #create-solution}

Cloud applications cross many aspects. For each aspect there are requirements and architecture decisions that must be assessed.
{: shortdesc}

You can simplify cloud architecture design and create a fit-for-purpose cloud solution by following five simple steps:

1. Use the architecture framework as a template, create a solution architecture heat map that highlights the aspects and domains relevant to the solution requirements.
2. Identify component options for each applicable domain in the solution architecture heat map.
3. Use decision tools to select the best-fit components for each domain based on requirements and constraints.
4. Document architecture decisions for the components associated with each domain.
5. Create a reference architecture diagram that illustrates how the main components of the solution come together.
