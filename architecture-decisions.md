# Documenting your architecture decisions
{: #decision-template}

After you evaluate the component options, you can use [architecture decision templates](https://github.ibm.com/cloud-docs-internal/writing/blob/draft/content-kit/solutions/architectural-decisions-template.md) to document the components evaluated, the decision criteria, and the component chosen for your solution based on the assessment performed when selecting the components.
{: shortdesc}

You should have one or more architecture decisions for each of the applicable domains that are highlighted in the solution architecture heat map mapped to your solution requirements.

Documenting the architecture decisions is important for several reasons:

- To provide traceability across the solution or application lifecycle and a historical record of why a particular decision was made.
- To capture interdependencies across solution components.
- To create the Bill of Materials (BoM) for your solution and build your cost case.
- To estimate delivery timelines and perform risk assessments.
- To transition to your application or build teams for delivery, detailed design, or scrum activities.
