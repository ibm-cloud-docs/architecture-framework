# What is the architecture framework?
{: #framework}

The architecture framework helps to create standard architectures by providing clear guidance for selecting components and how they fit together end-to-end. 
{: shortdesc}

Today, the cloud solution process is time consuming and often there are inconsistent solutions. But, with the architecture framework you can create consistent solutions by leveraging the structure to create reusable, repeatable solution architecture references and guidance.

Pattern
    : A pattern is a combination of fit-for-purpose components across one or more categories and technologies to meet specific enterprise requirements for cloud workloads.

Aspect
    : Aspects are architectural areas that need to be considered for any enterprise solution. Some aspects are associated with non-functional requirements like security and resiliency. Each aspect can have one or more domains.

Domain
    : Domains are common capabilities or similar technology functions within an aspect. For example, Enterprise Connectivity and Load Balancers are considered networking technologies.

Component
    : Components are product offerings that can be used to satisfy the solution requirements. The component options depend on the target cloud deployment and cloud provider. For example, Direct Link 2.0 and VPC VPN Gateways are Enterprise Connectivity components on the IBM Cloud.

## Cloud solutions
{: #cloud-solutions}

Cloud solutions cross many aspects. And for each aspect there are requirements and architecture decisions that need to be assessed.
