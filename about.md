# What is the architecture framework?
{: #framework}

The architecture framework helps to create standard architectures by providing clear guidance for selecting components and how they fit together end-to-end. 
{: shortdesc}

Today, the cloud solution process is time consuming and often there are inconsistent solutions. But, with the architecture framework you can create consistent solutions by leveraging the structure to create reusable, repeatable solution architecture references and guidance.

Evaluating options and designing a suitable architecture for comprehensive enterprise cloud solutions can be a daunting task. The use of an architecture framework can assist in enhancing the ability to design optimum cloud computing solutions. 

Cloud architecture can be thought of as a multi-dimensional matrix that considers application workloads, cloud deployment models, service management, and design aspects to provide a basis for cloud computing architectural designs that align with business drivers and requirements.  The architecture framework defines a taxonomy of "aspects" and "domains" that are used to develop architectural reference solutions or patterns for specific design requirements and constraints.

## Why use the architecture framework?
{: #why-use}

The architecture framework enables a more consistent approach to solutioning across the breadth of your cloud portfolio, which in turn decreases the solution process time and delivery risks.

It also provides the structure to create reusable, repeatable solution architecture references and guidance which leads to the standardization of enterprise cloud solution design and the avoidance of one-of-a-kind snowflake solutions that are expensive to deploy, enhance, and maintain.

The architecture framework can be used as a guide to ensure you have considered applicable requirements for each "aspect" and "domain". After you have identified the applicable requirements, you can evaluate and select the best fit for purpose components for your enterprise cloud solution.
